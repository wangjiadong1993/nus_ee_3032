 * this file code is only for this project, therefore, it is not comprehensive and there is some limitations
 * i will only implement some of the functionalities so that the whole sd card will work while the complexcity is
 * still managable.
 * I will open and close files from the root directory and i will never build more directories.
 * all the files will be placed in the root directory, they will be named as "year_month_day_hour.dat"
 * all the files are readable.
 * I will never delete any file.
