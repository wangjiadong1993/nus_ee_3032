# nus_ee_3032

It is an NUS EE 3032 project.

it is a programming project based on LPC 1769.

In this project, I used 

  SD card module  SPI FAT 32

  Blue Tooth  UART

  GPS   UART

  Temperature Sensor ADC

  Heating element GPIO

  GSM UART
  
The source code for each module is in the folder of corresponding name.

They are also integrated into the EE3032 Main folder which also contains the main.c, which is runnable.

Hope it is helpful to you.
